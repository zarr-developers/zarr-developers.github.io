The Zarr storage format is used in various domains and has active communities
for each field. These communities have established several conventions on top
of Zarr.<br><br>

Here are some of the conventions that are currently in use:<br>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Anndata</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openssbd/bdz">BDZ</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec">GeoZarr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/nczarr_head.html">NCZarr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ome/ome-zarr-py">OME-Zarr</a></li>
</ul>

If you're working on/know a new convention and want to add it to the list, feel free
to send a PR to the website <a href="https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-developers.github.io/">repository</a>.
