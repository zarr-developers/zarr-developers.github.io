Zarr is a community-driven open-source data format specification developed and maintained by diverse [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/teams). The Zarr contributors aim to maintain an open, equal, diverse, and inclusive community. Please read the [Zarr Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zarr-developers/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the appropriate way to interact with the community and help each other.

The Zarr community meets two times every two weeks via [community](https://zarr.dev/community-calls) and [ZEP meetings](https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/). Please have a look at our [community calendar](https://zarr.dev/community-calls/) for exact timings.

Feel free to explore the various communication channels mentioned below.

## Community meetings

Zarr community meeting notes, joining instructions, agenda and calendar are available at: [https://zarr.dev/community-calls](https://zarr.dev/community-calls)

## ZEPs

ZEP stands for Zarr Enhancement Proposal. A ZEP is a design document providing information to the Zarr community, describing a modification or enhancement of the [Zarr specifications](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a new feature for its processes or environment.

More info on ZEPs is available at: [https://zarr.dev/zeps/](https://zarr.dev/zeps/)

We hold bi-weekly ZEPs meetings to propose, discuss, review and finalize discussions around [current ZEPs](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft_zeps/) and [Zarr Specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs.html). More info available here: [https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/](https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/)
