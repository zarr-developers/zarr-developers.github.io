====

### Current status

* Development is ongoing via the core-protocol-v3.0-dev branch in the
  [zarr-specs repo](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs),
  follow
  [PR#16](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/16) for
  current status.

* Rendered docs from this branch can be [viewed on
  RTFD](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/).

* This is still a straw man, everything is up for discussion.

====

### Design principles

1. Hackable
2. Parallel
3. Distributed

===

### Design principles - hackable

* Easy to implement.
* Easy to extend with new functionality.
* Easy to inspect and manipulate metadata and data with generic tools.

===

### Design principles - parallel

* Think "what happens if two workers do X at the same time"?
* Avoid race conditions.

===

### Design principles - distributed

* Accommodate eventual consistency.

====

### Modular spec architecture

* [Core protocol spec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html)
* [Protocol extension specs](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions.html)
* Codec specs
* Storage specs

===

### [Core protocol spec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html)

* Minimal, easy as possible to do full implementation in any language.
 
* Aiming for intersection of N5 and Zarr v2 features.

* Defines a variety of **extension points** so can also serve as a
  foundation for growth and experimentation.

===

### Protocol extension specs

* Each protocol extension gets its own spec.

* Currently the core-protocol-v3.0-dev branch also includes some
  protocol extension specs, to illustrate the concept.
  
  * E.g., [Datetime data types
    spec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/datetime-dtypes/v1.0.html)

* Ultimately these extension specs should get split out into separate
  branches, so we decouple them from the core protocol spec.
  
* N.B., protocol extensions could also **modify** the core protocol
  (more on that later).

===

### Codec specs

* Each codec intended for use as a compressor or filter gets it's own
  spec.
  
* @@TODO create an example to illustrate the concept.

===

### Storage specs

* Each concrete storage system (e.g., file system, cloud object
  storage, Zip file, LMDB, ...) gets it's own spec.

* @@TODO create an example to illustrate the concept.

====

### Spec development process - current

* Currently @alimanfoo is acting as editor for the v3.0 core protocol
  spec.

  * Feedback/comments/ideas/contributions welcome from anyone at any
    time
    ([PR#16](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/16) is
    probably the best place for comments).
	
  * Still in a conceptualisation phase, no need for formal decision
    process as yet.

===

### Spec development process - future

* Ultimately I think we'll need to define a community process for spec
  development, so that:
  
  * It's clear how others can contribute.
  
  * It's clear how decisions get made.
  
  * It's clear what stage of maturity each spec is at.
  
* Don't have a solution for that yet, may need advice/help on best
  approach.

===

### Spec development process - freedoms

* Hopefully the [zarr-specs
  repo](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs) can serve as a
  focus for community spec development.
  
  * ...and the [zarr-specs RTFD
    site](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io) can serve as a discovery
    point for specs.
  
* However, don't want to force all spec development down the same
  route, or force all specs to be published in the same place.
  
  * This is one reason why currently the core protocol spec makes use
    of **URIs** in metadata to refer to protocol extensions and
    codecs - allow freedom for anyone to publish their own spec.

====

### [Core protocol - concepts and terminology](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#concepts-and-terminology)

*Hierachy. Group. Array. Name. Path. Dimension. Shape. Element. Data
type. Chunk. Grid. Memory layout. Compressor. Codec. Metadata
document. Store.*

* Are we comfortable with this terminology and how it is defined?

* Any important missing terms/concepts?

====

### [Core protocol - node names](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#node-names)

* Each node (array or group) in a hierarchy has a name.

* Node names are used to form node paths.

  * E.g., "/foo/bar" is a path identifying a node named "bar" whose
    parent is named "foo" whose parent is the root node.

===

### Node names - restrictions

* Node paths are used by users to access nodes and explore/navigate a
  hierarchy.

* N.B., node paths are also used to form storage keys (see later).

* To try and ensure compatibility with a variety of storage systems,
  the core protocol currently states fairly heavy
  [restrictions](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#node-names)
  on node names.
  
  * Includes restriction to ASCII alpha-numeric characters, "-", "_"
    and ".".

===

### Node names - restrictions

* Are we comfortable with the current restrictions? 

* Should we be aiming to support Unicode? Or is that a bridge too far
  for now?

  * Not sure what full implications would be, but supporting Unicode
    could make storage specs and implementations harder to develop.

===

### Node names - case (in)sensitivity

* N.B., some file systems are case sensitive, some are not.

* This can ([and
  has](https://github.com/cggh/scikit-allel/issues/215#issuecomment-434088283))
  led to bugs with the zarr v2 protocol when used with file system
  storage on different operating systems.
  
* Hard to resolve without annoying users (e.g., force all names to
  lower case) or complicating implementation (e.g., check for
  case-insensitive name clashes).
  
* I'm not happy with the spec's current approach to this.

====

### Core protocol - arrays

* Arrays have dimensions, shape and data type.

* Shape (length of dimensions) is finite.

  * But protocol extension could modify this to define behaviour for
    "[open-ended](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/323)"
    (i.e., infinite) dimensions.

====

### [Core protocol - data types](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#id5)

* Boolean (single byte)

* Integer (signed or unsigned; 1, 2, 4, 8 bytes; little- or
  big-endian)

* Float (2, 4, 8 bytes; little- or big-endian)

* Any other data type can be defined via a protocol extension

  * E.g., [datetime data
    types](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/datetime-dtypes/v1.0.html)

===

### Data types - identifiers

* Each data type needs an identifier for use in metadata documents.

* E.g., "bool", "i1", "<i4", ">u8", "<f2", etc.

===

### Extension data types - fallback

* Any extension data type can define a **fallback** which is a core
  data type with the same item size.
  
* Allow for graceful degradation of functionality.

* Should this be called "fallback"? Maybe "base type"?

====

### Core protocol - chunk grids

* A chunk grid defines a set of chunks which contain the elements of an array.

* The chunks of a grid form a tessellation of the array space, which
  is a space defined by the dimensionality and shape of the array.

  * => Every element of the array is a member of one chunk, and there
    are no gaps or overlaps between chunks.

===

### Grid types

* In general there are several different possible types of grid.

* The core protocol defines [regular
  grids](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#regular-grids).
  
* Other grid types could be defined via protocol extensions, e.g.,
  [non-uniform (rectilinear)
  grid](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/245).

* Any grid type must define:

  * How the array space is divided into chunks.
  
  * A unique identifier for each chunk in the grid (used to form
    storage keys, see later).

===

### [Regular grids](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#regular-grids)

* A grid type where each chunk is a (hyper)rectangle of the same shape.

* I.e., essentially the grid type used in HDF5, Zarr v2 and N5,
  although different behaviours for edge chunks, see below.

* Each chunk has a grid index, which is a tuple of grid coordinates.

  * E.g., grid index (0, 3, 7) means first chunk along first
    dimension, fourth chunk along second dimension, 8th chunk along
    third dimension.

===

### Regular grids - chunk identifiers

* Chunk identifier is formed from grid index.

  * E.g., chunk at grid index (0, 3, 7) has identifier "0.3.7".
  
* Default separator is "." but can be changed (e.g., to "/" as in N5)
  in array metadata (see later).

===

### Regular grids - edge chunks

* All chunks have the same shape.

* If the length of any array dimension is not perfectly divisible by
  the chunk length along the same dimension, the grid will overhang
  the edge of the array space.
  
* Spec currently doesn't say any more about how to handle edge chunks,
  maybe it should?

  * E.g., suggest using array fill value to fill contents of edge
    chunks beyond the array space.
	
* Other approaches (e.g., truncated edge chunks) could be defined as a
  different grid type via a protocol extension.

===

### Regular grids - resizing arrays

* Regular grid supports growing and shrinking an array along any
  dimension.

  * Growing only requires change to array metadata (update array
    shape), no chunk data needs to be added or modified.
	
  * Shrinking requires change to array metadata (update array shape)
    plus delete any chunks now completely outside the array space.
	
* Regular grid does not support [growing an array in "negative"
  direction](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/9),
  i.e., prepending.
  
  * But could define a grid type that does support this via a protocol
    extension.

====

### Core protocol - chunks

* What is a chunk? Logically, it's an N-dimensional typed array,
  containing data elements from a region of a Zarr array.

* Chunk shape, data type and memory layout are all defined in the
  metadata for the Zarr array in which the chunk belongs.
  
  * I.e., chunks don't need their own metadata (at least when using a
    regular grid).

===

### Core protocol - chunks

* When reading/writing chunks, expect implementations will use some
  appropriate class for managing typed memory blocks.
  
  * E.g., in Python could use
    [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.ndarray.html),
    [XND](https://xnd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xnd/index.html) or
    [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/data.html#arrays)
    (for 1D chunks).
	
  * E.g., in C could use
    [libxnd](https://xnd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libxnd/index.html).
  
  * E.g., in C++ could use
    [xtensor](https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container.html#arrays-and-tensors).

===

### [Chunks - memory layouts](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#id6)

* Memory layout (along with data type) defines binary representation
  for a chunk.

* Core protocol defines two memory layouts for chunks.

  * C contiguous (row-major).
  * F contiguous (column-major).
  
* Protocol extensions could define other memory layouts.

===

### [Chunks - encoding](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#chunk-encoding)

* Optionally, an array can be configured with a compressor.

* A compressor is a codec which can be used to encode and decode
  chunks during storage and retrieval.
  
* Support for filters (sequence of zero or more codecs applied prior
  to compressor during encoding) has been moved following
  [discussion](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/38)
  to a [protocol
  extension](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/filters/v1.0.html).

* N.B., codecs may be lossy, i.e., decode(encode(x)) round trip
  doesn't have to be perfect, but must preserve memory layout and data
  type.

===

### Codecs

* Currently, the core protocol spec defines a codec as a pair of
  algorithms (encode and decode) which each operate on a sequence of
  bytes.
  
* This should probably be modified so that [codecs operate on typed
  memory
  blocks](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/38#issuecomment-500858540),
  i.e., have access to information about data type, item size, chunk
  shape.

===

### How to define a codec?

* Publish a spec which:

  * Defines the encode and decode algorithms (or cites some existing
    documents that define them).
  
  * Defines any configuration parameters (e.g., compression level).

  * States the codec identifier, which must be a URI that dereferences to
    the codec spec.
  
    * The codec identifier is used in array metadata, see later.

* @@TODO example codec spec

====

### [Core protocol - metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#metadata)

* Each Zarr hierarchy is defined via metadata documents.

   * One [bootstrap
     metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#bootstrap-metadata)
     document.
   * Multiple [array
     metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#array-metadata)
     documents.
   * Multiple [group
     metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#group-metadata)
     documents.
   
* Metadata documents are defined using the JSON type system (objects,
  arrays, strings, numbers).
  
* Metadata documents are serialised (encoded) for storage.

  * Default encoding is JSON, but protocol extensions can define other
    encodings for group and array metadata, see below.

===

### [Array metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#array-metadata) - example

```json
{
    "shape": [10000, 1000],
    "data_type": "<f8",
    "chunk_grid": {
        "type": "regular",
        "chunk_shape": [1000, 100]
    },
    "chunk_memory_layout": "C",
    "compressor": {
        "codec": "http://purl.org/zarr/spec/codec/gzip",
        "configuration": {
            "level": 1
        }
    },
    "fill_value": "NaN",
    "extensions": [],
    "attributes": {
        "foo": 42,
        "bar": "apples",
        "baz": [1, 2, 3, 4]
    }
}
```

===

### Array metadata - example using extension data type

```json
{
    ...
    "data_type": {
        "extension": "http://purl.org/zarr/spec/protocol/extensions/datetime-dtypes/1.0",
        "type": "<M8[ns]",
        "fallback": "<i8"
    },
	...
}
```

===

### Array metadata - attributes

* N.B., user attributes are contained within the array metadata
  document.

* No constraint on content, up to user/application.

===

### Array metadata - attributes

Could be a flat set of name/value pairs, e.g.:

```json
{
    ...
    "attributes": {
        "foo": 42,
        "bar": "apples",
        "baz": [1, 2, 3, 4]
    }
}
```

===

### Array metadata - attributes

Could be deeply nested structure, e.g.:

```json
{
    ...
    "attributes": {
        "@id" : "arc:arc0",
        "@type" : [ "ome:Arc", "ome:ManufacturerSpec" ],
        "identifier" : "LightSource:1",
        "ome:arcType" : {
            "@id" : "arcType:Xe"
        },
		...
    }
}
```

<small>(This example probably needs to be fixed to properly use
JSON-LD, but hopefully the concept is clear.)</small>

===

### [Group metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#group-metadata) - example

Currently nothing but extensions and attributes:

```json
{
    "extensions": [],
    "attributes": {
        "spam": "ham",
        "eggs": 42,
    }
}
```

===

### [Bootstrap metadata](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#bootstrap-metadata)

* Bootstrap metadata is a new concept, not present in either Zarr v2
  or N5. Why add it?

* Provides metadata about metadata, e.g., what core protocol version
  is being used, what metadata encoding is being used.

* Allows for extensions to be declared that modify metadata and/or
  data layout or encoding or other protocol changes that apply
  globally to the entire hierarchy.
  
  * E.g., a protocol extension for [consolidated
    metadata](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#consolidating-metadata)
    could declare itself here, allowing an implementation to discover
    that consolidated metadata is available.
	
  * E.g., a protocol extension that uses [something other than
    JSON](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/37#issuecomment-499954809)
    for metadata encoding could declare itself here.

===

### Bootstrap metadata - further rationale

* Allows hierarchies to be self-describing (i.e., don't need
  out-of-band information to interpret).

* Allows implementations to provide appropriate error messages when
  unsupported protocol extensions/modifications are being used.

===

### Bootstrap metadata - example

```json
{
    "zarr_format": "http://purl.org/zarr/spec/protocol/core/3.0",
    "metadata_encoding": "application/json",
    "extensions": [
        {
            "extension": "http://example.org/zarr/extension/foo",
            "must_understand": false,
            "configuration": {
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

====

### Core protocol - stores

* All stores encapsulated by a simple [store interface](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#store-interface).

* The store interface comprises a set of operations involving keys and values.

  * A key is an ASCII string (with some restrictions).
  * A value is a sequence of bytes.

* Assume the store holds (key, value) pairs, with only one value for any given key.

  * I.e., a store is a mapping from keys to values.

===

### Store interface - capabilities

* If a store is **readable** it implements:

  * `get(key) -> value`

* If a store is **writeable** it implements:

  * `set(key, value)`
  * `delete(key)`

* If a store is **listable** it implements one or more of:

  * `list() -> keys`
  * `list_prefix(prefix) -> keys`
  * `list_dir(prefix) -> (keys, prefixes)`

===

### Store interface - set(key, value)

<p class="stretch"><img src="v3-update-20190619-files/storage.png"></p>

N.B., implementing `set()` is optional; if not implemented, store is
read-only.

===

### Store interface - get(key) &rarr; value

<p class="stretch"><img src="v3-update-20190619-files/retrieval.png"></p>

===

### Store interface - list operations

* List operations are required for discovering what groups and arrays
  a present in a hierarchy.

* List operations are optional; if not implemented, then the
  user/application has to find out what arrays and groups are present
  by some other means (e.g., via a protocol extension such as
  consolidated metadata or [groups listing their
  children](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/15);
  or some out-of-band communication).
  
* Why are there three different list operations in the store
  interface? More on that later.

===

### [Store implementations](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#store-implementations)

* As with current Zarr v2 and N5 protocols, goal of v3 store interface
  is to enable a range of store implementations using different
  storage technologies:
  
  * Local memory; file systems; zip files; local key-value databases
    (BDB, LMDB, Kyoto/Tokyo, LevelDB, ...); distributed key-value
    databases (e.g., mongo, redis, ...); relational databases; cloud
    object stores (S3, GCS, ABS, ...); ...

* Core protocol does not specify how to implement any of these. Leave
  that for **storage specs**.

===

### Storage specs

* Each storage spec defines how the store interface is implemented in
  some concrete storage system.
  
* Generally will be obvious, but not always, and worth being explicit.

* E.g., expect there will be a file system storage spec, which defines
  the following mapping:
  
Operation | Implementation
--- | ---
`get(key) -> value` | read contents of a file
`set(key, value`) | write contents of a file
`list_dir(prefix)`| list contents of directory
... | ...

====

### Storage protocol

* For each metadata document and chunk, need a unique **storage key**.

* In Zarr v2, storage keys formed like this, e.g., for 2D array at
  path "/foo/bar":

  * Array metadata document : "foo/bar/.zarray"
  
  * Chunk at grid index (0, 0) : "foo/bar/0.0"

* Two problems with the Zarr v2 protocol...

===

### Zarr v2 problem 1 - race conditions

* When creating a node at some non-root path, e.g., "/foo/bar", then
  v2 spec says groups MUST be created at all ancestor paths.
  
* E.g., to create an array at path "/foo/bar", need to first:

  * Check if a group exists at path "/foo", if not then create it.

  * Check if a group exists at path "/", if not then create it.

===

### Zarr v2 problem 1 - race conditions

* But if multiple arrays are being created in parallel, can lead to
  race conditions.
  
  * E.g., if arrays at "/foo/bar" and "/foo/baz" are being created in
    parallel, can get race conditions checking existence of and
    creating group at paths "/foo" and "/".
	
  * Further information
    [here](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/30#issuecomment-494085722).

* v3 goal: avoid race conditions when creating nodes in parallel.

===

### Zarr v2 problems 2 - inefficient

* Use case: user knows a group exists at path "/foo" and wants to know
  what children it has and for each child whether it's an array or
  sub-group.
  
* Use case: user wants a complete display of a hierarchy, i.e., some
  kind of tree view of all nodes and their types (array or group).
  
* With Zarr v2 protocol, both of these require [a
  lot](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/30#issuecomment-492990803)
  of calls to the store interface.

* On high-latency stores (e.g., cloud object stores) this can cause
  very noticeable delays.

* v3 goal: minimise store operations needed to explore/discover hierarchy.

===

### Avoiding race conditions - implicit groups

* Zarr v3 currently avoids race conditions during node creation by
  allowing **implicit groups**.
  
* E.g., to create an array at path "/foo/bar", only a single store
  operation is required:
  
  * `set(array_metadata_key, encoded_array_metadata)`

* By creating an array at path "/foo/bar", groups at all ancestor
  paths ("/foo", "/") are **implicitly** created.

===

### Hierarchy inconsistency?

* So, what happens if a user tries to do something that breaks the
  hierarchy model?

  * E.g., create arrays at paths "/foo" and "/foo/bar"? (So there is
    both an array and an implicit group at path "/foo".)

  * E.g., explicitly create both an array and a group at path "/foo"?
  
* Interesting question! Current v3 spec does not fully address this.

===

### Hierarchy inconsistency?

* My current opinion: it's the user/application's responsibility to
  avoid hierarchy inconsistencies.

  * I.e., a Zarr core protocol implementation is **not** required to
    check or enforce hierarchy consistency during node creation
    (because this is hard to implement in a parallel/distributed
    context).

* If an application needs to enforce hierarchy consistency, then it
  could implement some mechanism for synchronising node creation,
  and/or it could implement some mechanism for checking consistency
  after node creation.

===

### Making hierarchy discovery more efficient

* Current v3 resolves this by three means:

  1. Split the [storage key
     space](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#storage-keys),
     so all metadata keys have prefix "meta/" and all chunk keys have
     prefix "data/".
 
  2. Change the format of metadata keys slightly (see below).
	 
  3. Leverage the fact that many stores, including cloud object
     stores, can support `list_prefix(prefix)` and/or
     `list_dir(prefix)` operations, which natively list all keys with
     a given prefix.

===

### v2/3 comparison - storage keys

Bootstrap metadata ...

Version | Storage key

### v2/3 comparison - storage keys

Array metadata, e.g., for array at path "/foo/bar" ...

Version | Storage key
--- | ---
v2 | `foo/bar/.zarray`
v3 | `meta/root/foo/bar.array`

### v2/3 comparison - storage keys

Group metadata, e.g., for group at path "/foo/baz" ...

Version | Storage key
--- | ---
v2 | `foo/baz/.zgroup`
v3 | `meta/root/foo/baz.group`

### v2/3 comparison - storage keys

Chunk data, e.g., for chunk at grid index (0, 0) in 2D array at path "/foo/bar" ...

Version | Storage key
--- | ---
v2 | `foo/bar/0.0`
v3 | `data/foo/bar/0.0`
v3* | `data/foo/bar/0/0`

<small>* chunk key format can be configured in array metadata</small>

### [Core protocol](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#protocol-operations) - examples

* Initialize a hierarchy:

  * Perform `set("zarr.json", value)` where `value` is a serialised
    bootstrap metadata document.

===

### Core protocol - examples

* Create an array at path "/foo/bar":

  * Perform `set("meta/root/foo/bar.array", value)` where `value` is a
    serialised array metadata document.

===

### Core protocol - examples

* Create a group at path "/foo/baz":

  * Perform `set("meta/root/foo/baz.group", value)` where `value` is a
    serialised group metadata document.

===

### Core protocol - examples

* List children of group "/foo":

  * Perform `list_dir("meta/root/foo/") -> (keys, prefixes)`. 
  
  * Any returned key ending in ".array" indicates a child array.
  
  * Any returned key ending in ".group" indicates an explicit child
    group.
  
  * Any returned prefix indicates a child group implied by some
    descendant.

===

### Core protocol - examples

* E.g., find all nodes in the hierarchy:

  * Perform `list_prefix("meta/") -> keys`.
  
  * All nodes (including implicit groups) and their types (either
    array or group) can be inferred from the returned keys.

===

### Core protocol - examples

N.B., all of the above examples **required only a single store
operation**. This is both a significant simplification and efficiency
improvement over Zarr v2.
