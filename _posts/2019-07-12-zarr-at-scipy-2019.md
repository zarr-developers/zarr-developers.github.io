SciPy 2019 has been a great experience. It's been a huge pleasure to
present Zarr and explore ways that it can connect with all of the
other amazing developments in and around the SciPy ecosystem. Here is
the video of the Zarr presentation:

... and [here are the slides](https://zarr-developers.github.io/slides/scipy-2019.html).

Here is a selection of other talks and events at SciPy that did or
could connect with Zarr in some way...

@@TODO something about Pangeo BoF, diversity of people interested in
Pangeo's approach, getting data into a cloud-native format like Zarr
or cloud-optimised GeoTIFF is a key step.

@@TODO something about Sannon's talk on StarFish.

@@TODO please add anything else.
