Zarr is a data storage format based on an open-source <a
href="https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/">specification</a>, making
implementations across several languages possible. It is used in various
domains, including geospatial, bio-imaging, genomics, data science, and HPC. 🌏🔬🧬<br><br>

Implementations are listed (in alphabetical order) as follows:<br><br>
